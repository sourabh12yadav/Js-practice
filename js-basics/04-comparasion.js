// console.log(null>0);// false null treated as a number here so 0>0 result false
// console.log(null==0);// in case of equality null treated as undefined so it is also false
// console.log(null>=0);//Again compariosn operator comes than it is treated as a number so 0>=0  its true

console.log(undefined>0);//false  undefined is treated as a nan in case of any comparison
console.log(undefined>=0); //false undefined is treated as a nan in case of any comparison
console.log(undefined>=0);// false undefined is treated as a nan in case of any comparison
